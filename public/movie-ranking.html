<h1>The Best movies according to Yestxander</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Bicentennial Man</h3>

<p> This is one the most loved movies for me, the idea of a robot turning into a Man is incredible.</p>

<h3>The Lion King</h3>

<p> This is my favorite movie as a Kid (and Adult either), it has great songs and the story is outstanding.</p>

<h3>Spiderman into the spiderverse</h3>

<p> I love the idea of watching the 3 different spidermans from all the franchises is amazing! as spiderman! haha</p>
